<h1 align="center">Blog</h1>

<p>This project consists on a personal blog, in which the administrator is able to manage and create new posts. You can access a deployed version
of the app by clicking on the following link:<p>
<a href="https://gabao55blog.herokuapp.com/">Blog</a>
<p>However, the deployed version doesn't support images, so I recommend for a complete experience cloning the repo and running it by using the following commands:</p>

```
cd blog
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
